This project was developed as part of my work at [**Kluge Interactive**](https://klugeinteractive.com/).

A VR interpretation of arcade fighting games (think *Street Fighter*). **Final Fury** sets itself apart from other, often boxing-like and more grounded VR fighting games by bringing the usual fighting mechanics to VR: special moves, finishers, character archetypes, etc.

## Responsibilities

In this project, I was in charge of **designing and developing several main features and components:** the match-making client logic, implementation of several of the special moves on the characters, and the entire *enemy AI system* for the game's single player campaign and ladder modes.

The *AI system* was developed using *Node Canvas* to create easily customizable enemy behaviors without the need to write new code, thus the game designers could work with it.

I also helped with the first internal demo and closed Beta launches.
