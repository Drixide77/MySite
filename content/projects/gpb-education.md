This project was developed as part of my work at [**Visyon**](https://visyon360.com/).

An educational, interactive media app for **Georgia Public Broadcasting**. Comprising a mobile app for both *Android* and *iOS*, and a *VR* app for the *Oculus Quest* (originally design for the *Oculus Go*). The application was developed in *Unity*, using an in-house **framework for multi-platform XR apps**.

Links to the different version of the app can be found on **GPB**'s website: [https://www.gpb.org/apps](https://www.gpb.org/apps)

## Responsibilities

In this project, I was in charge of **developing several of the key systems and contents**. Namely, a 360Â° video player, an *AR* content module teaching the animal and plant cells, and the front-to-back end communication for the downloading of the content modules.

After the initial delivery to the client, I was also task with performing **maintenance tasks** on the app, including small updates, fixes, and working on a pipeline to automate certificate renewal for the *Apple App Store*.
