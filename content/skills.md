Throughout my professional career, I have been specializing in *video game development*. I do also have interest in immersive experiences and *VR* technology.

The *Unity Engine* and *C#* are the two technologies I have more hours of experience with, above all the others. I have also worked with many target platforms and devices, from mobile, to desktop, to oddball XR headsets and input/output devices.
